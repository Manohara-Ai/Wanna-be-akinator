# Wanna Be Akinator

**Wanna Be Akinator** is a Pokémon guessing game inspired by the classic Akinator game. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify Pokémon based on user responses. The project features implementations of decision trees and random forests to enhance guessing accuracy, with a focus on user interaction to construct input vectors for the model.

## Project Structure

- **`decision_tree.py`**: Contains the implementation of the decision tree algorithm.
- **`random_forest.py`**: Builds on `decision_tree.py` to implement the random forest algorithm.
- **`synthesis.py`**: Handles user interaction, asking questions to construct an input vector for the model to guess Pokémon.
- **`main.py`**: Integrates all components and executes the application.

## Features

- **Decision Tree-Based Guessing**: Uses decision tree algorithms to make Pokémon guesses.
- **Random Forest Enhancement**: Implements random forest for improved prediction accuracy.
- **User Interaction**: Asks questions to users and constructs input vectors dynamically.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wanna-be-akinator.git
   cd wanna-be-akinator
